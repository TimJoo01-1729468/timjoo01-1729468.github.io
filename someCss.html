            Hi my name is tim joo and I am from Tacoma, washington!
            I love to eat food, go on adventures, and have fun with
            everything that life can give! I hope that my life 
            can help others feel the joy and happiness that I know
            personally that life can offer!
        </p>
        <p class = "b">
            Overall, I am loving this info 101 class. It is very fun
            and challenging and really brings to life many of the aspects
            of technology that can't be found in typical STEM classes such 
            as math and sciences.
        </p>
